# ROBDD
Reduced Order Binary Decision Tree
Binary Decision Trees is a data structure that is mainly used to represent ‘Boolean Functions’. \
This data structure for n number of variables takes around 2n​ ​nodes. So the Reduced Ordered Binary Tree is created using 
Shannon’s Expansion to optimize memory usage.\
In this lab assignment, functions such as Build, Make, Apply, Restrict, SatCount and AnySat are implemented to create an ROBDD from a boolean Expression. .
